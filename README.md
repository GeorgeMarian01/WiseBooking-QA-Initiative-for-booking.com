# About the project
During my software testing training at ITSchool, I contributed to a project focused on testing the Booking.com platform. Under the guidance of my mentor, Radu Nițuc, a QA industry veteran with over 10 years of experience, I implemented and applied real-world best practices during the project.

The project primarily consisted of six user stories covering basic functionalities such as registration, account deletion, password reset, booking cancellation and sign in. During test design and execution, I conducted various test types, including functional, integration, system, and user acceptance testing.

There were used tools such as Postman for API Testing, JIRA for bug tracking and project management, and Xray for test case management. One of the main challenges we faced was prioritizing efficient test design and execution to ensure the best user experience. By putting ourselves in the users' shoes, we were able to understand their most important needs and create testware accordingly.

As a result of our rigorous testing process, we identified various issues and reported them to the Booking.com team. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also improved my ability to collaborate effectively and adapt to project priorities and needs.
